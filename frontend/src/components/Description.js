        The Legacy of RockWell is a simulator where you make various decisions
        with the intention of creating an innovative product, utilizing all the
        services and partners that RockWell Automation has at its disposal.
      </p>
      <p>
        The aim is to generate interest and promote the different services
        offered by RockWell. We want all users to engage with the simulator,
        develop their ideas, and understand the philosophy of the digital
        thread within the company, from the inception of an idea to its
        development.
      </p>
      <p>
        The simulator is designed to harness what users are interested in
        developing while using the technologies and services offered by the
        company. There will be a leaderboard showcasing new ideas, which won't
        just remain as ideas but can be realized with the help of the
        simulation. This dynamic approach aims to spark an interest that starts
        with the game and can grow into something beyond just a game.
